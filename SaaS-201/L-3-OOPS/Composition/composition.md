# Composition

In object-oriented programming we use the word "composition" in the same sense as in the sentence "matter is composed of atoms". In that same vein, we can say that a Ruby object is composed of other objects. For example, earlier we saw the Student class which had just a `name` and `roll_no`. Now, we will put it inside a Course class so each course will know which students are enrolled for it.
